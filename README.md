A pleasant frontend for transmission.

This project was only started recently and is very much an alpha.
Backwards incompatible changes might be made, but in general there should be 
no bugs on the master branch.

The intention is to provide a more user friendly interface compared to `transmission-remote`.

Here are some examples of things you can do easily that would require at least
some scripting with transmission-remote alone:

```sh
# Stop all incomplete torrents
trpc stop -i

# Start all torrents that live in a specific download dir
trpc start ~/torrent/foo/*
```


## Features

### Commands

`add`: add torrents by file or URL (-p to add paused)

`errors`: show torrents that have errors

`list`: list torrents

`move`: move torrents to another location

`rename`: Rename a torrent path or file

`rm`: remove torrents (--nuke to delete the data as well as the torrent)

`start`: start torrents (--now to jump queue)

`stop`: stop torrents

`verify`: verify (hash check) torrents

`version`: show version

`which`: show which torrents (and file ID) given file(s) belong to.

### Filters

Most commands above except for `add`, `version` and `which` accept filter arguments to limit the torrents acted upon (or displayed in the case of `list`):

`-i, --incomplete`: Include only incomplete torrents

### Torrents can be selected by ID or filename

Unlike `transmission-remote`, you can refer to a torrent by its filename. This allows easy shell globbing. Example:

```sh
# Pause all incomplete torrents in ~/torrents/recent
$ trpc stop --incomplete ~/torrent/recent/*
```
## Planned upcoming features (near future)

### More commands

`limit`: Set global/torrent upload/download rate limits

`files`: List files within torrents

`get`: set specified files to be downloaded

`noget`: set specified files to not be downloaded

`info`: Show detailed torrent info

`sessioninfo`: Show session information

`watch`: Show a progress bar for incomplete active torrents

### More filters

* `-t, --tracker`: Select only torrents using a particular tracker

* `-e, --error`: Select only torrents with a given error substring

### Sorting

* by size

* by name

* by id

## Planned features (possible, distant future)

* A TUI mode

* Support bittorrent clients other than transmission

## Installation

```sh
go install github.com/shric/trpc/cmd/trpc
```
